## Hadoops notes
# Tutorial: Hadoops with python

# Architectural design of HDFS
a. NameNode: metadata for the filesystem
b. DataNode: file blocks
HDFS clusters commonly consist of a dedicated server NameNode

NameNode: filenames, file permissions, location of each block of each file. In memory. Tracks the replication of blocks, ensuring no data loss due to machine failures. Secondary NameNode for backup.

DataNode: commodity machines with large storage. Replication factor (data replicated N times)
